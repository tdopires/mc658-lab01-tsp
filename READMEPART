In this directory, you can find many programs using the LEMON Library and the
the GUROBI integer linear programming solver. 
The LEMON Library can be found in the link: http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/
The GUROBI solver is free for educational institutions for academic/research
purposes.

Most probably, these routines/programs will change a lot in the near future.
So, be aware that this is the first version available in the internet. Hope 
stable versions will be available in the future.

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Install the GUROBI Solver
        http://www.gurobi.com/
	(see the file INSTALL_GUROBI, in portuguese)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2. Instalation of LEMON package
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to install LEMON package as root, go to Step 2.1.
Otherwise, if you want to install LEMON in the up level folder, go to Step 2.2.

Step 2.1. Download the LEMON package from the link

    http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/

    and install the package in the system. To build LEMON, you need to give
    the following commands in the LEMON directory: 

    ./configure 
    make
    sudo make install

Step 2.2 If you do not have permission to install as root, you can install
    the package in the up level folder using the script

    Install-Lemon-in-up-level-folder

    that installs the lemon package in the up level folder.
    To this end, you must have write permission in the up level folder.
    The script Install-Lemon-in-up-level-folder creates a uplevel folder
    called "lemon", download the file lemon-1.3.1.tar.gz and install the
    lemon package version 1.3.1 inside folder "lemon".

    You can also install LEMON in another folder. In this case, you must
    change the PATH in the Makefile (see Step 5).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3. Correcting the pdf reader.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
As some of the programs in this directory uses a pdf reader, open the file
thirdpartprograms.h, and change/comment the name of the pdf reader used in your
system. For example:

#define PDF_VIEWER "xpdf"  // To open a pdf file in Linux
or
#define PDF_VIEWER "open"  // To open a pdf file in Mac OS X

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4. Installing the graphviz package used to visualize graphs
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another package used to view graphs, is the graphviz package that can be
obtained from the link
http://www.graphviz.org/
When this package is installed, you can use two programs that are used
to transform a graph in the .dot format to a pdf format. These are the
"dot" and the "neato" programs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5. Building the executable files in this directory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, rename the file
Makefile-with-Lemon-installed (if the Lemon package is installed in the system)
or
Makefile-with-Lemon-installed-in-up-level-folder (if the Lemon package
was installed using the script Install-Lemon-in-subfolder, that can be found in
the up level folder) to Makefile

If GUROBI is not installed in a standard folder, you have to change the Makefile.
GUROBI_DIR = /Library/gurobi$(VERSION)/$(PLATFORM)
with the GUROBI directory used in your instalation.

The makefile uses a command "ar" to generate a lib called "mylib.a" from
the obj files: mygraphlib.o geompack.o myutils.o
You can use other command to generate such lib or you can change the makefile to 
use the obj files  mygraphlib.o geompack.o myutils.o  directly
without doing the lib file.

Then, you have to do the following command:

make

The executable files have suffix ".e"

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5. Testing the programs
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To test any of the following programs, you only need to run the program, without
any parameters. To see what they do, see the corresponding .cpp file.

ex_knapsack.e            (this program solves a random generated knapsack problem)
ex_fractional_packing.e  (Solves LP formulation of a packing problem (non-integer))
ex_tsp_gurobi.e          (Solves TSP on undirected graphs)


The program ex_tsp_gurobi.e  has a filename as argument. For example,

./ex_tsp_gurobi.e gr_berlin52          (52 places in the city of Berlin)
./ex_tsp_gurobi.e gr_usa48             (48 cities in the US)
./ex_tsp_gurobi.e gr_ulysses16

Files begining with "gr_" and not ending with ".steiner" are graph files.
The first number, say N, in the first line of such a file, is the number of vertices.

If this number is followed by a -1, you have an euclidean graph. In this case,
in the next N lines you can find a tuple "v, px, py" for each vertex v
(e.g. gr_100). The position (px,py) is the coordinate of the vertex v in the
plane. The graph is complete and distances are calculated by the euclidean
distance.

If after the number of vertices N you find a number M different of -1, then you
have a graph given by nodes and edges. The next N lines have the name of the
vertices (e.g. gr_50). Optionally, after the name of each vertex, you may give
the position px and py of the corresponding node (e.g. gr_att48). And after the
vertices, the next M lines you can find a tuple "u v weight" that is an edge
that connects vertex u and vertex v and has weight "weight".

Since this program is for didactical purposes it is very limited and is not
optimized.


Files begining with "gr_" and ending with ".steiner" are graph files for the
Steiner problem. In the first line of the file, we have the graph file name and the
number of terminals, which are listed in the subsequent lines.
The program steiner-directed has a filename as argument (the first line. For example,

./ex_steiner-directed.e gr_berlin52.steiner  (52 places in the city of Berlin)
./ex_steiner-directed.e gr_att48.steiner     (48 cities in the US)

In the execution of "ex_steiner-directed.e gr_berlin52.steiner"
the program opens the file "gr_berlin52.steiner" and, from the first line,
obtains the graph file name (in this case, we have "gr_berlin52") and the number
of terminals. So, for this problem, you need both files,
the file "gr_berlin52" and the file "gr_berlin52.steiner".


There is a script for bash, test_ex, that test most of the programs.
